import SwiftIO


// initiate the blue LED and set led as Blue:
let led = DigitalOut(Id.BLUE)

while true {
     // here is where you'd put code that needs to be running all the time.

     // set Blue LED off
     led.write(true)
     sleep(ms: 1000)	// interval at which to blink (milliseconds)

     // set Blue LED on
     led.write(false)
     sleep(ms: 1000)
}
